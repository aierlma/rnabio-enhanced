# RNAbio-Enhanced Dockerfile

This Dockerfile was developed as I explored RNA-seq tools. It closely follows the installation steps provided by the rnabio image as outlined on their [Tool Installation page](https://rnabio.org/module-00-setup/0000/10/01/Installation/), but includes slight modifications to tailor it to specific requirements.

These changes help adapt the setup to more precisely fit the needs of my projects while maintaining the integrity of the original rnabio configuration.

Feel free to explore this Dockerfile, and adapt it as needed for your research or projects!
